Of course I don&#039;t mind, actually, I&#039;m excited to know about the practices that you have learning working at HE:Labs. :D



I hope when you start to use PR in your daily basis let you improve the code, knowledge share and make programming even more joyful. Please, when you start to use let us know about your experiences. 


Thanks!]]></description>

Hi Marcelo, thank your for your asking. We do pair programming occasionally, mainly in tasks when a developer needs some help. But even when we do pair programming, we also open a pull request for everyone in the team to review.

The thing I like the most in pair programming is seeing how a experienced team member works. For example, I can find some anwsers for how they approach the task and start to type the code, how they debug, what are they editor shortcuts, the bash alias, git commands and other tools they use. 

This practice is also useful for me when I have a lot of doubts in a task, with a partner at my side we can avoid misconceptions, create a better code for review and :shipit:.

I like this way, not 100% of time, only when someone or task really need a special attention.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations Ulisses! You are very lucky to work with the most wise rails ninjas!

I was wondering if you guys do pair programming on daily bases, and if you do so, how that has contributed for your professional growth.

Thank you for sharing your experience.]]></description>
