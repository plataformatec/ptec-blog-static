					<description><![CDATA[Hi! Very nice update! I was actually one of those people that asked if there was a possibility for using another attribute (other than the email attribute) to do authentication with. For my next project (which I&#039;ll be starting on soon) I was still undecided whether to go with Authlogic or Devise. Not because I&#039;d rather use a &quot;username&quot; over &quot;email&quot;, because the next project will probably use the email attribute to authenticate, but because I don&#039;t want to continuously change authentication gems because depending on whether I need another attribute or not. But this update made me decide to go with Devise with new introduction of the scoped authentication feature. Next to just being able to say: &quot;Use the Username Attribute&quot;, that you can say: &quot;Use the Username Attribute that belongs to &#039;this&#039; subdomain/account/website&quot; or whatever. This is actually the perfect solution for one of my current projects, so you at the same time inspired me with this blog post!

Thanks a lot!]]></description>
