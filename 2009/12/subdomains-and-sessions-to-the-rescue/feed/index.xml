					<description><![CDATA[@daniel Thanks, Ghost is really a nice tool. Storing the mail in the database seems great when you use rake tasks or cron jobs, or even a background job to send emails.

@eric Thanks for the tip.

@andrew Nice plugin, I&#039;ll take a look at it. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wrote a slightly similar plugin for dealing with segregated data sets. I had similar needs but nobody should be able to share any data with any other subdomain. Check it out: http://github.com/penguincoder/acts_as_restricted_subdomain

There is a fork that has support for recognizing the entire domain, as well so you aren&#039;t limited to just subdomains.

I use the plugin in a medical environment and it works great for keeping everything separate while allowing for a multi-homed application.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing about subdomains that I never see addressed:

You&#039;ll want to make www.subdomain.domain act the same as subdomain.domain, especially if you&#039;re writing an application that will be used by the general public. A very large percent of the population think everything on the web has to start with &quot;www.&quot; even if you tell them otherwise. The press will do the same thing, no matter how much effort you put into giving them the correct URL.

So, save yourself from a lot of headache, and your users from a lot of confusion, by just making the two equivalent in your application.]]></description>
