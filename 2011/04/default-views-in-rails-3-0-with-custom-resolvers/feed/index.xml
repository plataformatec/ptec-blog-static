					<description><![CDATA[Resolvers are a powerful abstraction that allows you to customize template
lookup. This post is just one example of the several things you can do with
resolvers. The book goes through another example and shows how you can
create your own resolver that searches for templates in the database,
instead of the filesystem. In other words, you should not ignore this post
nor the book contents, because they explain and show you how resolvers work.
You just won&#039;t need to create a resolver as above if you need template
inheritance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this article. I&#039;m applying this good stuff to one of my projects where I was using symlinks in app/views for that and it was a bit messy. There is a typo on append_view_path (no &#039;s&#039; at the end), but except that, it was very simple to take your code and adapt it :)]]></description>
