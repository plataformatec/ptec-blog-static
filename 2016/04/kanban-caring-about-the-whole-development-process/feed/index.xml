					<description><![CDATA[Well said. I believe that one of the biggest advantages of Kanban is that it allows each member of a team to be involved (in one way or another) in every step of development process. In my office everyone benefits from Kanban (we use http://kanbantool.com,/ which is an online Kanban board). Managers divide workload and assign tasks via Kanban boards, senior manager oversees the whole process and adapt next assignments to team&#039;s abilities by looking at progress chart and remote employees are able to participate in brainstorming and ideas exchange without traveling. It really makes our work easier!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree. The whole team has to be responsible for the process. of course it&#039;s always good to have a more focused person in it. the best gain kanban against the scrum for me was the delivery more consistent and higher quality. In my opinion kanban it&#039;s good to see the stories status and with that in mind, everyone can help to delivery.]]></description>
