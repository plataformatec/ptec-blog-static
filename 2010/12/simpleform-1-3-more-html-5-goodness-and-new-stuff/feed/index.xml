					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a huge fan of this library. I recently switched over from Formtastic to it because I felt it was less opininated about markup and had better i18n support. You achieve a nice balance on how heavily the utility can be configured as well.

Nice work! I&#039;m looking forward to its continued development!]]></description>

Hello mate, thanks for your feedback.

Just to clarify, the :tel option, besides adding the css classes, also changes the input type of the field in question (input[type=tel]), which is a new HTML5 option.

Now about the lack of docs on how to add new form element types, you are right. We are planning to write a new blog post on that subject soon, so stay tunned =).
Thanks for the tip.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great library, very lightweight, and I am implementing it throughout all my projects.  Almost all of my integration tests still passed after dropping this in for formtastic (after &#039;semantic&#039; -&#062; &#039;simple&#039;).

The only thing that is really lacking is documentation about adding new form element types.  Basically I say this only because:

The :tel option seems to be nothing more than adding a class of tel to the input field.  Is the intention for js to come in and customize the text inputs based on their css classes?  I realize that phone numbers are *massively* complicated with internationalization, so having a phone element be too flexible is probably a pain for you guys to do.  So on my end I want to add the phone element I made for formtastic so I&#039;m searching for a *clean* way to do that.

If there was even a simple example of doing this sort of thing it would be awesome.  As it is I am cobbling a solution together that works via monkeypatching, but since that&#039;s not very Rails-3-ish I was wondering what the &quot;official&quot; plataforma technique is for extending simple_form.

Thanks!]]></description>
