					<description><![CDATA[Why do we need to stop and re-start bluepill after a deploy? Aside from it not working properly for me on OpenSUSE 11, I would think that an init script that starts when the server starts would be the way to go, no?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My solution was missing an &quot;export RAILS_ENV;&quot; to work properly (but the rest of the comment is still correct: &quot;sh -c&quot; (hidden in a Kernel.exec(&quot;cmd-string&quot;) call) does not accept bash specific syntax.)

Chris&#039; solution is neater and shorter, but it can even be made shorter by not prefixing env with its path ;-).

Bash syntax &quot;VAR=val cmd&quot; is just a shortcut for &quot;env VAR=val cmd&quot; when you do not need to use the -i option of the env command to have it &quot;to completly ignore the environment it inherits&quot; -- env(1).]]></description>
