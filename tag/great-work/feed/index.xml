										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We cannot express how excited we are with such great news. In our last blog post we were celebrating Rafael&#8217;s achievement and just a few months later we are celebrating again. Years ago, having three Plataformatec teammates as Rails Core members would be something we&#8217;d only dream of, but in 2012 it became reality. I must say that it didn&#8217;t happen by chance, not at all.</p>

<p>Carlos has always been an outstanding software developer and a great teammate. He is someone we all deeply trust to solve hard problems and deliver mission critical projects. We&#8217;ve always watched Carlos working really hard and we must say that he deserved every bit of such achievement.Â You can check out his contributions into many other open source projects at <a href="http://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva">http://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva</a></p>
<p>Kudos to our friend @cantoniodasilva!!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last May we happily announced that Rafael FranÃ§a and Carlos Antonio earned commit access to the Ruby on Rails repository &#8211; it was a great accomplishment that deserved its own blog post. Today, we have some great news and we want to share with our readers. Just a few days ago, our team mate Rafael FranÃ§a (<a href="http://twitter.com/rafaelfranca">@rafaelfranca</a>) received an invitation to join the Rails Core Team. And, of course, he accepted!</p>
<p>Rafael contributed to different features coming up in the next Rails 4 release and worked extensively with other Rails contributors to smash bugs and provide many improvements to the framework. I am personally happy to have a friend joining me in the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core">Rails Core Team</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rafael FranÃ§a&#8217;s contributions go beyond Rails. Lately he has also contributed to many other open source projects, like <a href="http://mongoid.org/">Mongoid</a>, <a href="https://github.com/github/janky">Janky</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mperham/dalli">Dalli</a> besides Plataformatec&#8217;s own projects like <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>, <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">Simple Form</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>.</p>

<p>Rafael, congratulations! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no secret that our team has a great passion for contributing to the open source community and once in a while we receive compliments &#8211; it is great to have our work recognized; thank you all for always being supportive. =D</p>
<p>We&#8217;d proudly like to announce that, due to their contributions, two specific members of our team were recently awarded by the Ruby on Rails community (by the Rails Core Team, to be more precise).</p>
