Hello Chris :)

Yeah, I do know ActiveAttr - it&#039;s a great gem btw, congrats - and that it&#039;s created to be modular. That&#039;s ActiveModel&#039;s goal as well, to provide pieces that you can use to build up your classes/models. I just think that ActiveModel gives you the API to be flexible enough to create the functionality you need, and usually not some functionality out of the box. ActiveAttr takes it a step further and implement its modules on top of ActiveModel, giving you a final implementation for common cases, which is great =). 
Thanks for your feedback.

Â Carlos, you may want to take a closer look at ActiveAttr. While it does offer the all-in-one Model module, it&#039;s made up of slices of functionality that I think captures the spirit of the ActiveModel library.]]></description>

Hey Joris, sorry but what do you mean about &quot;defining a form&quot;? Would you mind trying to exemplify your idea? 

The change we are showing in this post helps you create a model with some plug and play functionality, the api you need to use with Rails helpers - ie form_for and url helpers.. but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s only tied to a form.

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can you use this inline? i.e.: use this to define a &quot;Form&quot;, instead of a model?

imo rails confuses &quot;Form&quot; with &quot;Model&quot;... Â Ofcourse it should be easy to create a form from a model, but this is where the annoyance started]]></description>

I believe ActiveModel::Model is a great start, it makes it a lot easier to get a barebone model with the most common required interface up and running quickly. Other than that, Rails already provides everything else required to create AR-like classes, you just need to cherry-pick what you need, when you need. ActiveAttr is great in the sense of collecting all available modules in ActiveModel as a convenience, but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;d be a great fit for Rails to have an all-in-one module like it.

Thanks for your feedback.]]></description>
