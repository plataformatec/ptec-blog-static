					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to say thank you, because you made me realize that I&#039;ve been incorrectly expecting rails to magically add indexes for me. I had no reason to expect this - I know the framework well enough. But it suddenly occurred to me as I was reading tip #2 that I had an app that had been in production for months, one that I was in the process of trying to work out the apparent bottlenecks in throughput, and which had no indexes on any foreign keys. I nearly kicked myself. Hopefully these generator enhancements will save me from a good self-kicking in the future.]]></description>

Although given that the view path was derived from the mode&#039;s class name, you could argue that it already was. I&#039;ve had need of this feature for rendering diverse collections of objects, so I&#039;m glad to see it implemented.]]></description>

That&#039;s something else altogether. #cache_key is a bona fide general purpose model method; it&#039;s the model identifying itself a short name that&#039;s consistent in certain conditions.

#to_partial_path, by contrast, is strongly tied to the ActionView layer. Were it an ActiveRecord method, I&#039;d be bothered, but Jose rightly points out that it&#039;s ActiveModel, so could and should be implemented on presenter objects instead of AR objects.]]></description>

Does a model defining #cache_key which can be leveraged by view code  also break concerns? I do not think so.]]></description>
