Thank you! I would say a month from now is not an unreasonable expectation, at least for a beta release.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I first encountered the Phoenix Framework about a year or so ago I was very dismayed that it appeared to be trying to rebuild Rails in Elixir. Why, why, why would anyone try to shoehorn an OOP framework into FP? Recently, I decided I&#039;d better learn Phoenix anyway (how bad could it be?), and began reading the excellent new book.

I&#039;m delighted to report that I was totally wrong about Phoenix. In almost every way, it does things right, which is to say the FP way. Awesome. Models, however, were one area that still seemed a bit suspect. I think that getting rid of them is a capital idea, and am very much looking forward to Ecto 2. Any idea when it might be ready?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome work! I&#039;m actually excited for the removal of callbacks. Few features of Rails have given me more pain that those.

I&#039;d like to bring attention to a very timely post by Daniel Berkompas on replacing Ecto callbacks with GenEvents: http://blog.danielberkompas.com/2015/12/08/use-gen-event-with-ecto-callbacks.html. His approach adds some complexity, but also gives you more control and could be a good replacement for anyone looking to migrate their Ecto callbacks before 2.0.]]></description>
