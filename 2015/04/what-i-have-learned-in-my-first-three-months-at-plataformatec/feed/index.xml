Hey Daniel, thanks for the comment!

We do it in multiple ways, but that depends on the matter:

- Basecamp posts for proposals, discussions and announcements
- Blogposts 
- GDrive&#039;s forms/sheets to collect data from ceremonies and processes

Let me try to give you some exemples: 

- After meetings we add a compilation of what we&#039;ve discussed to a basecamp post. This way everyone can check the conclusions and add doubts, thoughts or questions about it. 

- If we learned or developed a new practice that helped us out we write basecamp posts about it or/and also blogsposts so we can share it.

I hope this could help you, let me know if you have any thoughts about it. o]]></description>

Now I think this communicative culture is really great, it opened my mind and is helping me to learn a lot!

I&#039;m glad I could help, thanks man! :D]]></description>
