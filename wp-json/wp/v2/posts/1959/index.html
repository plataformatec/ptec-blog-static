Let&#8217;s say you have a bunch of controllers inside the <code>Admin<\/code> namespace and you would like each action to fallback to a default template. So if you are rendering the index action for <code>Admin::PostsController<\/code> and &#8220;app\/views\/admin\/posts\/index.html.*&#8221; is not available, it should then render &#8220;app\/views\/admin\/defaults\/index.html&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>There are several ways to implement this feature at the controller level. It mainly relies on trying to render the original template and then rescue <code>ActionView::MissingTemplate<\/code>. If this error is rescued, you then render the default one. However, there is a considerable performance overhead in this approach as it needs to pass through the rendering and template lookup stack twice.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, since Rails 3.0, we have a new abstraction called <strong>resolvers<\/strong> that holds the logic to find a template. I explain comprehensively how resolvers work and their API in my book <a href=\"http:\/\/plataformatec.com.br\/crafting-rails-applications\/\" target=\"_blank\">Crafting Rails Applications<\/a>. So here I would just show the basics to get this functionality working.<br \/>\nFirst, we need to define a <code>DefaultResolver<\/code>, it could be done inside the lib directory:<\/p>\n<pre lang=\"ruby\">\r\nclass MyResolver < ::ActionView::FileSystemResolver\r\n  def initialize\r\n    super(\"app\/views\")\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def find_templates(name, prefix, partial, details)\r\n    super(name, \"admin\/defaults\", partial, details)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Our new resolver simply inherits from <code>ActionView::FileSystemResolver<\/code> and does two changes: Overrides the <code>initialize<\/code> method so the view path defaults to \"app\/views\" inside our application and overrides <code>find_templates<\/code>. The <code>find_templates<\/code> method receives the template name, a prefix (i.e. the controller path), a boolean marking if the template is a partial or not and a hash of details. In the example above, we simply ignore the prefix given and hardcode it to \"admin\/defaults\".<\/p>\n<p>Now, assuming that all controllers inside the Admin namespace inherit from an <code>Admin::ApplicationController<\/code>, we can add default views to all of them by adding the following line:<\/p>\n<pre lang=\"ruby\">\r\nclass Admin::ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\r\n  append_view_path MyResolver.new\r\nend\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>And we are done! The <code>view_paths<\/code> holds a list of paths and\/or resolvers that the controller will look for templates until one is found. If none is found, an <code>ActionView::MissingTemplate<\/code> is raised. Since we used <code>append_view_paths<\/code>, our resolver was added after the \"app\/views\" path, used by default in all controllers.<\/p>\n<p>As you may have guessed, resolvers are a powerful abstraction that allows you to retrieve templates from anywhere, including the database, which is the example given in <a href=\"http:\/\/plataformatec.com.br\/crafting-rails-applications\/\" target=\"_blank\">Crafting Rails Applications<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, template inheritance was a feature recently added to Rails master (upcoming Rails 3.1), so you won't need to create your custom resolver as above. <a href=\"http:\/\/edgerails.info\/articles\/what-s-new-in-edge-rails\/2011\/01\/12\/template-inheritance\/index.html\">There is a good wrap up about this feature in Rails Edge<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is common in Rails 3.0 applications that you want to provide default views for a group of controllers.
