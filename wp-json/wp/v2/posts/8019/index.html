Advent of Code was created by Eric Wastl and it starts on December 1st of every year. We get one new puzzle per day, until December 25th, with a total of 25 puzzles.<\/p>\n<p>In previous editions, many people have used Advent of Code to learn a new programming language, including Elixir. This year we will be joining you so we can all learn Elixir together! In particular, Jos\u00e9 Valim (that&#8217;s me!), the creator of Elixir, will live stream and solve the puzzle from the previous day and share it with everyone. This gives everyone time to try the puzzle on their own so we can discuss different approaches live.<\/p>\n<p>The live stream will happen daily on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/josevalim\">Twitch<\/a>, for 25 days, at 15:00 CET \/ 14:00 UTC \/ 12:00 BRT \/ 9:00 EST. During the streams, I will go over my solution, step by step, explaining Elixir concepts and the thought process behind it. This is a great opportunity to join, ask questions, give feedback, propose solutions, help me get unstuck, etc. If you can&#8217;t make it to the live stream, the videos will be available online on Twitch for 14 days.<\/p>\n<p>How can you prepare?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first step is to read <a href=\"http:\/\/elixir-lang.org\">Elixir&#8217;s Getting Started guide<\/a> or one of our many Learning Resources<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Do the exercises from <a href=\"https:\/\/adventofcode.com\/2017\">last year<\/a> or from <a href=\"https:\/\/exercism.io\/\">exercism.io<\/a> to warm up.
