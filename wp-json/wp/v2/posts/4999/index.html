As technology evolves, this scenario gets more and more common. When you need to set up a meeting between distributed teams, it usually leads to frustration. Noise, poor sound quality, interruptions and lack of focus tend to erode communication and make things chaotic.<\/p>\n<p>As a consultancy, we have learned a lot about remote meetings along the way and realized that we can help other teams to deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips to do remote team ceremonies effectively.<\/p>\n<h2>Setting up the tools and the environment<\/h2>\n<h3>A video call tool with screen sharing capabilities<\/h3>\n<p>Google Hangouts works fine for us. If your internet connection isn&#8217;t good, Hangouts allows you to reduce the bandwidth consumption.<\/p>\n<p>Appear.in and Zoom.us also do the job quite well.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these tools limit the number of simultaneous users. To deal with that limitation, ask people that are in the same building to get themselves together.<\/p>\n<h3>Speakers with omnidirectional mic in both ends of the call<\/h3>\n<p>Notebooks speakers and microphones were designed to be used by the person sitting in front of the screen. They don&#8217;t work well when you want to talk to and hear several people at different positions in a room.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend using an external speaker with an omnidirectional mic in both ends of the call. We use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Jabra-SPEAK-510-Bluetooth-Softphone\/dp\/B00AQUO5RI\/ref=sr_1_7?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450888756&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=jabra\">this one<\/a>. They are cheap and can work miracles in sound quality.<\/p>\n<h3>A proper place in both ends of the call<\/h3>\n<p>Speakers are loud. Pick a place where your sound won&#8217;t annoy people around and people around won&#8217;t annoy the ones in the conference either. Keeping sound quality in mind, look for places with low noise, like meeting rooms.<\/p>\n<h2>What do you need to do before and during the meeting<\/h2>\n<h3>Make sure the ceremony has a clear objective and a clear timebox<\/h3>\n<p>These are basics for any meeting. Everyone should know what must be accomplished and what role they are performing. Talk about it in the beginning if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Every time you feel the conversation won&#8217;t help to get to the expected output, tell people and get back to the topic.<\/p>\n<p>Set a timebox and follow it. People&#8217;s time is precious and having discipline shows that you respect that. Here&#8217;s an important trick: if you start and end a meeting in the specified timebox, with time, it tends to improve the meeting quality, even though in the first one you might end the meeting without the expected output.<\/p>\n<h3>Make sure remote people can see what local people see<\/h3>\n<p>People are visual. Having something to look at while trying to understand a problem helps a lot.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re showing things on a TV or projector, share the screen with the remote ones.<\/p>\n<h3>Make sure remote people can hear what local people hear<\/h3>\n<p>It may look obvious, but it not always happen.<\/p>\n<p>Multiple discussions may occur simultaneously; someone will start to talk too far from the mic, and sometimes the remote folks are simply ignored. Focus and engagement will be gone.<\/p>\n<p>Interrupt politely and offer guidance every time it happens, explaining the reason.<\/p>\n<h3>Make sure there is a clear shared understanding<\/h3>\n<p>Stop from time to time and ask if there are any questions, especially if the discussion involves a complex subject.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes different understandings of the same issue can appear, and people on the other side don&#8217;t feel comfortable to interrupt and confirm.<\/p>\n<h2>Spread the word<\/h2>\n<p>Educate more people around this issue! It will make remote ceremonies even easier.<\/p>\n<p>We hope this little guide helps.
