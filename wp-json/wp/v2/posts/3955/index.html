Even though I&#8217;ve attended the last 5 RubyConf \/ Rails Summit here in Brazil, this was my first time at RailsConf in the US, and I have only one word to TL;DR it: <em>awesome<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Chicago is a welcoming city, there are lots of nice tourist attractions to visit, and the conference was a great opportunity to meet new people, share ideas, collaborate, and learn new things from the well selected list of talks. But all of this is quite hard to explain in words, so I&#8217;ll go with the <em>a picture is worth a thousand words<\/em> motto and show you a series of pictures, hopefully they will show you better what I mean.<\/p>\n<h2>The conference<\/h2>\n<p>The highlight of the first day was DHH&#8217;s keynote about clarity, patterns and TDD, which sparked many conversations\/discussions during the day. Farrah Bostic also gave a nice keynote at the end of the day, entitled <em>What Happens to Everyone, When Everyone Learns to Code<\/em>, which added even more to the topic DHH had covered.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/2014\/05\/railsconf-2014\/img_20140422_094954\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3966\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3966\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_20140422_094954-e1399472288546.jpg\" alt=\"RailsConf 2014 - DHH's keynote - TDD\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/2014\/05\/railsconf-2014\/attachment\/1398193531211\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3956\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3956\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/1398193531211.jpg\" alt=\"RailsConf 2014 - Plataformatec\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/1398193531211.jpg 600w, https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/1398193531211-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the second day I was a bit nervous, since I was going to give my very first talk in English, <a href=\"https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/carlosantoniodasilva\/tricks-that-rails-didnt-tell-you-about-at-railsconf-2014\"><em>Tricks that Rails didn&#8217;t tell you about<\/em><\/a>.

It was an opportunity to talk to different people and understand how they use the framework and the real problems they have, but it was not a very busy time for everyone, so some contributors had time to sit together and hack some stuff. What came out of that is <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rafaelfranca\/rails-tools\/blob\/master\/bin\/mark_stale_issues\">a script to label stale issues on the Rails repository<\/a>, marking them to be closed later in case no feedback is given in a timely fashion.

Rafael returned to Brazil on this day, heading to Recife for the Abril Pro Ruby conference where he was speaking (expect another blog post on this soon).<\/p>\n<p>On the last day the closing keynote was a super awesome talk by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tenderlove\">@tenderlove<\/a>, where he showed us that there&#8217;s a real need for science on our work, and then he merged AdequateRecord to Rails master while on stage! Well, not really on stage, but it&#8217;s merged :D. We also handed on our last Devise, Simple Form, Elixir, and Hacking Beautiful Code stickers.
