Just a couple weeks ago they announced the beginning of the integration with Elixir. Micka\u00ebl, can you tell us a bit more about what is Ejabberd and why are you excited about Elixir?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Micka\u00ebl R\u00e9mond<\/strong>: Ejabberd is a large scale messaging platform. You can build a lot of different types of system with it. You can build chat systems, game platforms, machine to machine internet of things kind of platforms. When I dug deeper into Elixir I found a great opportunity to make it a language to power Ejabberd and to make it possible to write custom systems for all these kinds of applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Micka\u00ebl R\u00e9mond<\/strong>: Now that Elixir is integrated into Ejabberd, it\u2019s very easy to write a plugin where you can extend its behaviour. For example, for the internet of things it is going to be a critical step for the platform, in my opinion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Valim<\/strong>: Great! So, you\u2019re bringing Elixir&#8217;s productivity and expressivity with all the power and features you have in Ejabberd, and making that available to developers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Micka\u00ebl R\u00e9mond<\/strong>: Yeah, exactly. It was a bit difficult to develop for Ejabberd and we\u2019re making Ejabberd development available to a larger crowd. Our goal is to make Ejabberd a platform and build an ecosystem around real time messaging in general.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Valim<\/strong>: Awesome! Thank you very much.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Micka\u00ebl R\u00e9mond<\/strong>: Thank you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/subscribe\/\"><br \/>\n  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/subscribe-to-our-blog.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to our blog\" style=\"margin-top:-55px;margin-bottom:15px;\"\/><br \/>\n<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few months ago we had the opportunity to interview Micka\u00ebl R\u00e9mond about his experience using Elixir in production.
