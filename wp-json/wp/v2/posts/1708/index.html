Frankly, this strategy has been working fine for us but in order to keep it running this way, we are\u00a0constantly looking for\u00a0mastering our work all the time. Otherwise, if we don&#8217;t, there will be a great chance of losing our competitive\u00a0edge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2)&#8230; responsibility comes along with autonomy<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>\n<dl id=\"attachment_1648\">\n<dt>\n<div id=\"attachment_1648\" style=\"width: 368px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1648\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1648   \" title=\"with great power, comes great responsability\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/peter.parker.uncle_.ben_.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;with great power, comes great responsability&quot; - uncle ben\" width=\"358\" height=\"265\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1648\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">&quot;with great power, comes great responsibility&quot;<\/p><\/div>\n<\/dt>\n<\/dl>\n<\/div>\n<p>In last year&#8217;s post we mentioned that we only hire professionals that we feel\u00a0comfortable\u00a0giving autonomy, but it&#8217;s important to remember that it must be used very carefully. So,\u00a0although autonomy makes a great pair with the constant search for mastery, don&#8217;t forget to be very cautious when dealing with\u00a0decisions\u00a0that might have a great impact in your company. We usually handle this kind of situation with two simple practices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we show our team, in a very explicitly way, the goals and guidelines that should de followed;<\/li>\n<li>and we constantly gather the team to discuss important issues (see the item below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>3)&#8230; gathering \u00a0the team to discuss problems is a great way to find solutions<\/strong><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1652\" style=\"width: 430px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1652\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1652 \" title=\"gather your team and discuss problems and solutions\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/listenup.jpg\" alt=\"gather your team and discuss problems and solutions\" width=\"420\" height=\"231\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1652\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">gather your team and discuss problems and solutions<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Once in a while we face\u00a0situations\u00a0that are a bit more risky or complicated to be solved by our selves alone. They can be technical or design problems, a project\u00a0management\u00a0issue or even a simple warm-up for a business meeting. For all this we usually gather two or three team mates to ask for their opinion and discuss about the options that we might have.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4)&#8230; projects managers shouldn&#8217;t delegate work or\u00a0establish\u00a0random deadlines.

We see it as a system that must work synchronized. Also, the actions of\u00a0planning,\u00a0estimating\u00a0and taking\u00a0decisions in a project\u00a0\u00a0should be made by the whole team (and not only by the manager). We found out that serious problems might arise when this system is desynchronized or made only by one person.<\/p>\n<p>In our opinion, the manager role is to assure that developers and designers have the proper atmosphere to do their best. And by &#8216;proper atmosphere&#8217; we mean that they have to provide the right tools (hw and sw), proper workplace, avoid useless\u00a0interruptions\u00a0and support the team when they get stuck with something.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5)&#8230; establishing roles is good and we avoid hierarchy levels<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>\n<dl id=\"attachment_1690\">\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<\/dl>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_1729\" style=\"width: 269px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/carell_boss.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1729\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1729\" title=\"do not create communications layers between team and managers and leaders\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/carell_boss.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"306\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1729\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">do not create communications layers between team and managers and leaders<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Some managers try to list and predict 100% of the problems that might happen in a project. Here at Plataforma Tec, we assume that it&#8217;s impossible to do so. Therefore the big deal is NOT about trying to predict and avoid 100% of the problems. The deal is to BE PREPARED TO REACT when a problem happens and trying to avoid the most obvious problems that could happen.<\/p>\n<p>Ok, but what does it all have to do with\u00a0<strong>Roles vs. Hierarchy<\/strong>?<br \/>\nCheck this: if we are prepared to react to a problem, first we must DETECT the problem. Right?<\/p>\n<p>So,\u00a0that&#8217;s where\u00a0hierarchy\u00a0kicks in&#8230; there is a great chance that creating\u00a0<a title=\"A Scary Old Study of Airplane Cockpit Dynamics: The Dangers of Fearing Authority\" href=\"http:\/\/bobsutton.typepad.com\/my_weblog\/2009\/02\/a-scary-old-study-of-airplane-cockpit-dynamics-the-dangers-of-fearing-authority.html\" target=\"_blank\">hierarchy levels will degrade the communication quality<\/a> in you company. This is one of the reasons we avoid creating different levels here at Plataforma Tec. Instead, we prefer defining roles. Developers should develop, Managers should support, Salesmen should sell (but synced with the whole &#8220;system&#8221; mentioned in item &#8220;4&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble understanding the difference between Roles and\u00a0Hierarchy, take a look at Scrum&#8217;s roles (as an example of\u00a0definition\u00a0of roles).<\/p>\n<p><strong>6)&#8230; business leaders must create the right policies to enable all the items above<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>\n<dl id=\"attachment_1665\">\n<dt>\n<div id=\"attachment_1665\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1665\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1665\" title=\"new policy\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/new-policy-fail1.jpg\" alt=\"new policy\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1665\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">policies should be discussed, not imposed<\/p><\/div>\n<\/dt>\n<\/dl>\n<\/div>\n<p>All these practices won&#8217;t be effective if the organizational leaders don&#8217;t believe and provide the right policies to really enable them.
