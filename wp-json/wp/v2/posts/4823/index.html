Bruce, tell us a little bit more about your work, what do you do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bruce Tate<\/strong>: I\u2019m Bruce Tate and I work at a market research firm called icanmakeitbetter. We do surveys, journals, and a new service called Chat, to help people learn more about their businesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Valim<\/strong>: Awesome. I\u2019ve heard you get to run Elixir in production.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bruce Tate<\/strong>: We\u2019re very excited to finally be running Elixir in production. We started working with our chat service in the Ruby language, but then we thought that we can\u2019t be as efficient or as reliable as we needed to be with the new set of customers that we were bringing on. Elixir is going to give us the ability to do that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Valim<\/strong>: What makes you most excited about Elixir?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bruce Tate<\/strong>: The scale that we can hit is absolutely fantastic, but to get to that scale we don\u2019t have to compromise on the programmer productivity. We\u2019re very small shop and we really need to be able to grow quickly and respond quickly to our customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Valim<\/strong>: Thank you a lot.
