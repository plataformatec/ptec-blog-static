Erlang Factory San Francisco is one of the biggest events in the Erlang community. One of the things that got me most excited about it was how many people were excited and talking about Elixir throughout the event.<\/p>\n<h2>Elixir talks<\/h2>\n<p>The event itself had a whole track dedicated to Elixir. I may be biased but the talk that I liked the most was Valim\u2019s one. In his talk, he explains what Elixir is about and how the language foundation is enabling Elixir maintainers to explore different strategies for laziness, parallelism and distribution. You should definitely watch it:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lqo9-pQuRKE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div>\n<p>Besides Valim\u2019s talk, there were many others. Jamie Winsor shared his experience in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_i6n-eWiVn4\">developing a whole Massively Multiplayer Online Game platform using Elixir<\/a>. In another room, Frank Hunleth introduced the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tCg1LakJF3g&amp;index=26&amp;list=PLWbHc_FXPo2h0sJW6X2RZDtT1ndw6KKpQ\">Nerves Project to run Elixir in embedded devices<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll not comment on each one of the talks because this week&#8217;s Elixir Radar will be a special edition focusing only on the Elixir talks at Erlang Factory. <a href=\"http:\/\/plataformatec.com.br\/elixir-radar\">Subscribe to Elixir<\/a> Radar and stay tuned!

It was awesome to see how many developers are falling in love with Elixir.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, many of them are already running Elixir in production! So Valim and I decided to grab our phones, order a microphone from Amazon and record some video interviews to show their experience running Elixir in different environments, from marketing and video companies to messaging systems and embedded devices.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re still editing those videos, but as soon as we get them done, we\u2019re going to publish them in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/plataformatectv\">our Youtube channel<\/a> and will announce them here and in our <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/plataformatec\">Twitter account<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more <a href=\"http:\/\/plataformatec.com.br\/elixir-radar\">Elixir news<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update (04\/23\/2015)<\/strong><br \/>\nWe already have a video teaser of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ls97Fbc4z3A\">interviews we did with companies using Elixir in production<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ls97Fbc4z3A\">Check it out<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/plataformatec.com.br\/elixir-radar\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/elixir-radar-subscribe.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to Elixir Radar\" style=\"border:none;\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two weeks ago Jos\u00e9 Valim and I went to Erlang Factory San Francisco and we had a great time.
