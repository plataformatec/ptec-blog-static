This version completely drops support for Rails 3.1 and Ruby 1.8.7, only keeping compatibility with both Rails 3.2 and Rails 4, running with Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.0.<\/p>\n<p>This rc version took some time to get ready, we&#8217;ve been running a <em>rails4<\/em> branch for some time already and one of the reasons was because of the changes required to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/plataformatec\/devise\/commit\/c63483ae2409ba44889756796930f5d45630d7b3\">make it compatible with the new <strong>strong parameters<\/strong> API from Rails 4<\/a>. We are aware that some people have been using this branch since Rails 4.0 beta1 with success, and we&#8217;re now inviting you to try 3.0 rc with the <a href=\"http:\/\/weblog.rubyonrails.org\/2013\/5\/1\/Rails-4-0-release-candidate-1\/\">recent release of Rails 4.0 rc1<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Devise stable<\/h3>\n<p>Together with the 3.0 beta version, we&#8217;ve released Devise 2.2.4 with a few enhancements and bug fixes, make sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/plataformatec\/devise\/blob\/v2.2.4\/CHANGELOG.rdoc\">check the changelog<\/a> to see the new goodies. All changes are also included in the rc version.<\/p>\n<h3>Simple Form<\/h3>\n<p>Simple Form has been running a 3.0 rc version for a couple months already, fully compatible with Rails 4 as well, and today we are releasing its release candidate version. In Simple Form master we just dropped support to the 3.x Rails series, focusing our work on Rails 4 compatibility from now on, due to a series of improvements in Rails 4 regarding form helpers &#8211; but don&#8217;t worry, we will be keeping a v2.1 branch with Rails 3.2 compatibility for a while.<\/p>\n<p>We have some cool plans to improve the wrappers API even further, but that&#8217;s subject for another blog post :).<\/p>\n<h3>Responders<\/h3>\n<p>Responders has been around for quite some time already and we use it in most of our projects, so today we&#8217;re celebrating its 1.0 release candidate version, specially to support Rails 4.<\/p>\n<h3>Show For<\/h3>\n<p>Show For just got a new stable release, v0.2.6, with all the enhancements and bug fixes that were in master, plus a v0.3.0 rc version that adds Rails 4 support.<\/p>\n<h3>Mail Form<\/h3>\n<p>Mail Form also got a new 1.5 rc release with Rails 4.0 compatibility. Nothing else has changed from the current 1.4 version.<\/p>\n<h3>Has Scope<\/h3>\n<p>Has Scope is getting a new 0.6 rc version with Rails 4.0 compatibility, including a couple of fixes that were already present in master.<\/p>\n<h2>Compatibility<\/h2>\n<p>All these new releases are officially dropping support to Rails 3.0 and 3.1, and Ruby 1.8.7. We&#8217;ll keep compatibility with Rails 3.2 and 4.0 from now on, all of them on the same branches except for Simple Form which has different branches for each Rails version.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping up<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got new hot releases for you to try out with Rails 4, please give them a try and let us know if you find any issue or have any feedback.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;d also like to specially thank everyone involved in helping us getting these projects up and running in Rails 4, without you folks that&#8217;d have never been possible.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy &lt;3<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Devise 3.0 rc version with Rails 4 compatibility and new 2.2.4 stable version.
