Garth, can you tell us a little bit about what do you do?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Garth Hitchens<\/strong>: I manage a development team at a company called Rose Point Navigation Systems and we build navigation systems for both recreational and commercial marine markets, and we are also building embedded devices. We\u2019ve been using Elixir for our embedded device\u2019s projects and absolutely loving it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Valim<\/strong>: Oh, great! So, are you already shipping Elixir software?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Garth Hitchens<\/strong>: We are shipping devices that actually run Elixir code. I have one of them here. This is an interface device that basically converts ethernet to other protocols that are common on boats (\u2026). This runs Elixir, it boots in a few seconds and we\u2019ve been absolutely in love with the platform, it\u2019s been great for us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Valim<\/strong>: Awesome! It\u2019s very exciting to see Elixir in there and the Erlang virtual machine and everything else, that\u2019s really cool! And, what is the thing that you are most excited about Elixir?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Garth Hitchens<\/strong>: I think the language is particularly elegant, I get to give you credit there. I came to Elixir from a long history of programming languages including C, C++, Ruby, Python, Lisp, so I love the work macros and homoiconicity that you have done. And I like the way that it gives me powerful abstractions to rapidly develop things. Plus, the Erlang VM has been rock solid. We\u2019re using Frank Hunleth\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/nerves-project.org\/\">Nerves package<\/a> to embed Erlang and Elixir on these products and it works really well, and I highly recommend to anybody.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Valim<\/strong>: Awesome. Yeah, I was just at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tCg1LakJF3g&amp;list=PLA9E5Lsig6GTBPb2BRf_2ONIcnRTU5Iy0&amp;index=6\">Frank\u2019s talk<\/a>, it was an exciting talk. And I\u2019m planning to get some SumoBots and start to play with them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Garth Hitchens<\/strong>: Yeah!
