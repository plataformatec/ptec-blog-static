It felt very solid and we liked it.\u00a0But since we&#8217;ve founded Plataformatec we have learnt lots of new things, launched dozens of apps and we&#8217;ve met new great clients. Because of this, we brought new people onboard to complement us, with skills we didn&#8217;t have before.<\/p>\n<p>Today, our team has engineers, designers, agile project managers and some business guys too. It would be more accurate if our visual identity\u00a0incorporated them too. We still like to be seen as software engineers, but now, our team and services scope has grown.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you like our new look.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be shy!\u00a0Take a look into our\u00a0<strong><a title=\"Plataformatec\" href=\"http:\/\/plataformatec.com.br\">new website<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0and our\u00a0<strong><a title=\"Plataformatec's Facebook page\" href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\/plataformatec.com.br\">page on Facebook<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0and tell us what you think.<\/p>\n<p>By\u00a0the way, we&#8217;ll keep using @plataformatec twitter account for\u00a0announcements, so keep following us. \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are excited to present our new visual identity and website.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"ngg_post_thumbnail":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2595"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2595"}],"version-history":[{"count":30,"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2595\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2631,"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2595\/revisions\/2631"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2595"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2595"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2595"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
