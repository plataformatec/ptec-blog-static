So we have been out in the city looking for a new house for us. We took our time to pick a new place for us to call of &#8216;Headquarters&#8217;, that wasn&#8217;t an easy task to do. We chose a beautiful and charming antique house, but since it is almost 100 years old, it needed to go through a lot of repairs and improvements to accommodate the Plataformatec team.<\/p>\n<p>So, while we are in between places, some of our teams are working remotely across different places in the city as we wait for our new office to be ready. But thanks to our heavy usage of asynchronous communication channels our productivity looks the same as before. We use tools like Basecamp, GitHub, Skype and Campfire to get our things done and talk about our projects &#8211; from like code reviews to scope related discussions and everything else &#8211; without getting in the way of anyone who might be busy with something else, so when we end up working apart it isn&#8217;t such a big deal since we are used to communicate and work in some sort of remote way.<\/p>\n<p>But while some developers would jump out of happiness for the chance of working from homes, I miss that good old office that I used to commute to everyday, because <strong>I don&#8217;t go to work to work<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In all these months at Plataformatec the office has proven to be much more than a place to write code and do our work. It became a place to share our stories, to improve our craft, to build our projects together and to have fun with our friends. So working from home without the whole &#8220;HQ Experience&#8221; isn&#8217;t quite the same thing for me and some of the others members of our team.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3551\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3551\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/visiting.jpg\" alt=\"Our first tour in the new Headquarters.\" style=\"width:100%\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3551\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/visiting.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/visiting-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/visiting-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3551\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our first tour in the new Headquarters<\/p><\/div>\n<p>All of the effort we have put into developing and maintaining our culture and values has reflected in a work environment completely different from any average consulting office, and as the company grows and we improve our values we hold the responsibility to keep improving\u00a0our HQ for everyone who is or will be part of the company.<\/p>\n<p>We couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled about this.
