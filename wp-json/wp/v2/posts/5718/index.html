We went to a bar with some conference speakers. It was really fun to chat with everyone there. Besides, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sdogruyol\">Serdar Do\u011fruyol<\/a>, who talked about the Crystal framework called Kemal, brought us a box of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkish_delight\">Turkish Delights<\/a>. And when I say &#8220;delights&#8221;, I mean it :yum:.<\/p>\n<p>During the event, I made new friends and met old ones. I had great conversations about hiring, team building, technologies and mainly Ruby and Elixir. It is very clear that the community is more mature than ever.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/rubyconf-brazil-2016-auditorium.jpg\" alt=\"RubyConf Brazil 2016 auditorium\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Talking about Elixir, this year there were a high number of languages being talked about. As I could list, I&#8217;ve seen talks about Clojure, Crystal, JavaScript, Go, Ruby and Elixir.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing that caught my attention was the large number of people trying Elixir in Brazil. I was even more surprised to know that a lot of them already have production-running apps. Here are some interesting talks about Elixir:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>10 things I&#8217;ve learned in my first Phoenix + Elixir Project (a Rubyist point of View), by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fbzga\">Fabiano Beselga<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Building a Twitter clone with Phoenix and Vue.js, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/philipsampaio\">Philip Sampaio<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Measuring your Elixir application, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/renanranelli\">Renan Ranelli (Milhouse)<\/a><\/li>\n<li>How Elixir helped us scale our video user profile service for the Olympics, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/emerleite\">Emerson Macedo<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Phoenix for Rubyists, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/michaellnorth\">Mike North<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Elixir dev to prod: challenges encountered, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nirev\">Guilherme Nogueira<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, eight coworkers from Plataformatec spoke at the event. Some about Ruby, some about Elixir and some about development process and culture. I&#8217;d like to greet them and also list their talks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/peagha\/do-asp-dot-net-para-o-rails-as-melhores-partes\">From ASP.NET to Rails: the best parts<\/a>, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/philHenri\">Philippe Hardardt<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/flaviafortes\/como-funciona-o-rails\">How does Rails Work?<\/a>, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FlaFortes\">Flavia Fortes<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/wesleytz\/como-consertar-projetos\">How to fix projects<\/a>, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wesleyzapellini\">Wesley Zapellini<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/yteruia\/rails-5-and-its-new-features-by-examples\">Rails 5 and its new features by examples<\/a>, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yoteruia\">Yoshio Teruia<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/erichkist\/debugging-techniques-in-elixir-elixirconf-2016\">Debugging Techniques in Elixir<\/a>, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erichkist\">Erich Kist<\/a> (this talk was <a href=\"http:\/\/confreaks.tv\/videos\/elixirconf2016-debugging-techniques-in-elixir\">presented in English<\/a> in last ElixirConf)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/igorffs\/voce-nao-esta-sozinho-va-pra-producao-com-elixir\">You&#8217;re not alone, go to production with Elixir<\/a>, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/igorflorianfs\">Igor Florian<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/diegorv\/seguranca-em-aplicacoes-rails\">Ruby on Rails Security: common faults and some not so obvious<\/a>, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/diegorv\">Diego Viera<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/speakerdeck.com\/lucas\/the-zen-and-art-of-refactoring\">The Zen and Art of Refactoring<\/a>, by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lucasmazza\">Lucas Mazza<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ebertapp.io\/?utm_source=our-blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog-posts-ptec&amp;utm_content=rubyconf-2016\"><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/ebert-app-plataformatec.jpg\" alt=\"Ebert App\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Also, I am very excited to say that <a href=\"http:\/\/ebertapp.io\">Ebert<\/a>, the first Plataformatec product, went public during the event.
