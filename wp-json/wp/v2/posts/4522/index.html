I&#8217;ll list a few points that I think are being great so far.<\/p>\n<h2>Be pragmatic and agile<\/h2>\n<p>Plataformatec is a very pragmatic company that is in a constant learning process. We are always alert for possible knowledge acquirement. <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/2015\/01\/empirical-knowledge-formalization-in-project-retrospectives\/\">Empirical knowledge is analyzed with care<\/a>, we try to document everything for further usage. A good experience is always a candidate for a practice and when it&#8217;s not, it becomes useful for future projects or similar situations.<\/p>\n<p>Our practices are continuously being re-evaluated to assure that they still fulfill their purpose. We&#8217;re not afraid of deprecating them when it&#8217;s needed, but we always collect data from them for continuous improvement.<\/p>\n<h2>Teams should share without being afraid<\/h2>\n<p>Sharing what you&#8217;ve learned is great for helping people and get feedback from them. In the other hand, sharing doubts isn&#8217;t easy as it seems. People tend to ask for help in a private context so fewer people know about it. I always remember my teachers saying in the class: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be ashamed of asking any doubts&#8221;. But that happened anyway, because being mocked was never good.<\/p>\n<p>Our team is composed of really nice and helpful people. We enjoy helping people and we share with each other pretty much everything we think it&#8217;s interesting.  It&#8217;s very common to hear someone here saying &#8220;a doubt from one person could be the same from another person&#8221; or &#8220;I may have a right answer for you, but it&#8217;s quite possible that someone has a better way to do this&#8221;. Doubts can be a great source of feedback and knowledge when they are public. That&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t usually use private communication tools unless it is something personal.<\/p>\n<h2>Open source culture<\/h2>\n<p>Like many people, I got to know Plataformatec for its contributions to the open source community. But when I joined the company, I noticed that the open source ideas go even deeper here. I&#8217;d say that Plataformatec&#8217;s soul is open source not only because of its software contributions but also because of its way to approach everything else.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that I have learned a lot about code review and documentation, but the contribution practices here goes beyond that. Lots of things we do are made with the help of the whole team: from pull requests to blog posts, to ceremonies and company decisions. We are very communicative! Take a look at this <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/2015\/03\/continuous-communication\/\">blog post to know more about our communication processes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>These were the points that I think are the most interesting to share so far. I hope I can contribute more and more to this team and to share what I learn with you along this journey.<\/p>\n<div style=\"padding:40px 0 20px;\">\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/subscribe\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/subscribe-to-our-blog.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to our blog\" style=\"border:none;\" \/><\/a>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It hasn&#8217;t passed too much since I&#8217;ve begun working at Plataformatec, but I&#8217;ve learned a lot already!
