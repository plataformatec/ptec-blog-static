id=\"data-analysis\">Data Analysis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After analyzing the data, I reached some conclusions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It\u2019s possible to verify that cards worthing 3, 5 or 8 points have a development time (lead time) similar, not being possible to find a correlation between time and the number of story points (it is not scalar).<\/li><li>If we take a category with plenty of samples, like the cards with 5 points, it\u2019s evident they differ a lot, not being possible to make some affirmations such as \u201ca card worth 5 points takes between X and Y days to finish\u201d when X and Y a small interval of days (1 to 3 days). The same happens with cards with 3 and 8 points.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Observation:<\/strong>&nbsp;Data referring to cards worth 1, 2 or 13 story points were excluded from the individual analysis, because there was little data to be analyzed individually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-analysis-beyond-story-points-x-lead-time\">Other Analysis beyond story points x lead time<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I reached more conclusions about the use of story points that I would like to share with you all:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>At the beginning of the project, when we started to use story points, the subjectivity was very high. By establishing some criteria for estimation, we were able to stabilize it, making the time of development vary a lot less, increasing predictability. If you want to develop this with your team, consider checking out this article from&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mountaingoatsoftware.com\/blog\/what-are-story-points\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Cohn<\/a>.<\/li><li>With the addition of more scoring criteria, like test complexity, dependency on people that are not in the team (internal or external to the company), risks related to the cards and more, we lowered the lead time variability and increased the card delivery rate by breaking the card into smaller ones.<\/li><li>Many times people relate story points with only the development effort, and this makes the team consider only the time of the Execution of a task. Another point is that the testers\/QAs and UXs\/designers, have little to no involvement in the estimatives. Making the team think not only about development, but also about the duration of the process as a whole (considering the steps of code review, tests, deploy, etc) and inviting more people to share their concerns about the estimatives helps to improve the predictability of the team.<\/li><li>With help from metrics like&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/2017\/10\/metricas-ageis-cumulative-flow-diagrams-e-lead-time-breakdown\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">lead time breakdown and CFD<\/a>, the process of stabilizing the scoring was much easier, as it made the team think about the whole process and showed in which step of the process the team was spending the most time with.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The major conclusions I had were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It wasn\u2019t possible to relate time of development (lead time) with Story Points directly, as the goal of the study was.<\/li><li>It is important to say Story Points should be used inside the team level.

Basically, the team considers how long it will take for a demand to be developed and tested, but don\u2019t consider in this estimatives (as it is not possible to predict some points in the middle of the development) how long the demand will be staying in waiting to be tested, to be deployed or how long it will take to resolve a hypothetical impediment.
