In other words, as the Thomas reference, we use the concept of <strong>Production Lead Time <\/strong>(the clock starts when work begins on the request and ends when the item is delivered. In software development this is sometimes called \u201cEngineering Lead Time\u201d and in Manufacturing \u201cManufacturing Lead Time\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Usually, when you plot out the Lead Time data on a histogram, you would expect to see the preponderance of the frequencies nearby the average value, with about half of the distribution above the average, and half below, as you can see in the images.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5165\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/normal-symmetric-distribution.jpeg\" alt=\"normal-symmetric-distribution\" width=\"609\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/normal-symmetric-distribution.jpeg 609w, https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/normal-symmetric-distribution-300x170.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This scenario is common when you are dealing with a normal or symmetric distribution. However, you will observe a slightly different pattern when you study the Lead Time distribution of an agile team.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5164\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lead-time-distribution.jpeg\" alt=\"lead-time-distribution\" width=\"609\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lead-time-distribution.jpeg 609w, https:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lead-time-distribution-300x170.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As we know, a software development process has different characteristics if compared to the standard manufacturing process (e.g., work items follow one of many possible sequential processes; the effort for each process step is different for each work item; work has a natural uncertainty that brings variability for the system).<\/p>\n<p>Studying a little bit more about software development distributions, I found <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weibull_distribution\" target=\"_blank\">Weibull<\/a>, a type of distribution that has been used in life data analysis.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/connected-knowledge.com\/2013\/08\/01\/how-to-match-to-weibull-distribution-in-excel\/\" target=\"_blank\">Alexei Zheglov<\/a>,\u00a0Weibull is a family of distributions, parameterized by the shape parameter (\u03b2) and the scale parameter (\u03b7). It can assume the characteristics of many different types of distributions because changing the \u03b2 can tweak the shape of the distribution curve.<\/p>\n<p>When \u03b2 is equal to 1, <strong>Weibull<\/strong> is identical to the exponential distribution. In the other case, when \u03b2 is equal to 2, Weibull is just like Rayleigh distribution, and is possible to interpolate\/extrapolate those distributions for other values of the\u00a0parameter.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about the impact of the parameters on shapes, I recommend you to read the paper written by <a href=\"http:\/\/focusedobjective.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/The-Economic-Impact-of-Software-Development-Process-Choice-Cycle-time-Analysis-and-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Results.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Troy Magennis<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Trying to make the following content easier to understand, I will use in the rest of this blog post a set of data from two Plataformatec projects as examples to explain the concepts.

The table below shows the project&#8217;s parameters and to get that information I used some R code and the spreadsheet developed by <a href=\"https:\/\/connected-knowledge.com\/?attachment_id=1806\" target=\"_blank\">Alexei Zheglov<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Weibull parameters<\/h3>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"padding:5px\"><\/th>\n<th style=\"padding:5px\">Project A<\/th>\n<th style=\"padding:5px\">Project B<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">Shape<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">1.47<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">1.5<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">Scale<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">15.81<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">7.22<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">R-squared<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">0.98<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">0.93<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>In both cases the Weibull distribution fit well for the dataset (If the match is perfect, the r-squared number will be equal to 1). After analyzing an amount of different datasets, <a href=\"https:\/\/connected-knowledge.com\/2014\/09\/08\/how-to-match-to-weibull-distribution-without-excel\/\" target=\"_blank\">Alexei Zheglov<\/a> observed some characteristics based on the shape parameter.<\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"padding:5px\">Shape<\/th>\n<th style=\"padding:5px\">Meaning<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">Less than 1<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">The distribution curve is convex over the entire range. This shape parameter range occurs often in IT operations, customer service and other fields with a lot of unplanned work.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">Between 1 and 2<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">The curve is concave on the left side and through the peak and turns convex on the back slope. This shape parameter range occurs in product development environments.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">Greater than 2<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">The curve is convex on the left side, then turns concave as it goes up towards the peak, and turns convex again on the back slope. This distribution shape often occurs in phase-gated processes (waterfall).<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>In both cases, the shape was close to 1.5 which means a concentration of lead times on the left side of the curve. The shape parameter defines data distribution, but does not affect its location or scale.<\/p>\n<p>Something interesting to share is that as mentioned at the beginning of the text, both projects were <strong>greenfield<\/strong> type, which is consistent with the classification presented above (product development environments).<\/p>\n<p>Based on the shape of the curve (1.47) and the scale (15.81) it is evident that project A worked with long items, which should have generated a great WIP. This type of situation typically occurs when there is a large number of external dependencies and delays over the process.<\/p>\n<p>With these parameters in hand, you as an Agile Coach could identify and help the team to remove impediments and delays, as well as decrease the value of the scale parameter and <strong>bring greater predictability to the development process<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of project B, we have an interesting combination of shape (1.5) and scale (7.22) because rarely in a context of a product development, the team could have a different lead time distribution format.<\/p>\n<h2>Summary<\/h2>\n<p>In this blog post, I tried to <strong>bring a new way of analyzing Lead Time<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As software developers, we deal with some uncertainties, questions, and changes that produce high variability in our process.<\/p>\n<p>Learning to understand and interpret the data extracted during development allows us to discuss ways to optimize and continuously improve something that is, in essence, complex (and fun), that is to build solutions.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding how to estimate the correct parameters of the distributions has been significant for the exercises we have done at Plataformatec, creating quantitative models to predict delivery dates.<\/p>\n<p>Good reading recommendations on this subject are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alexei Zheglov and a set of excellent texts of agile metrics, distributions, and probability functions &#8211; \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/connected-knowledge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/connected-knowledge.com\/<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Troy Magennis and his rich material on quantitative methods and software development &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/focusedobjective.com\/news\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/focusedobjective.com\/news\/<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What about you?
