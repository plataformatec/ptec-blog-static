Visibility is the transparency of your team&#8217;s process. It means allowing all stakeholders to know what you are doing, how you are doing and why you are doing. It doesn&#8217;t mean giving every smallest detail of your process, but they need to have all necessary information to drive their goals according to your team&#8217;s progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When stakeholders don&#8217;t have the appropriate visibility, they might underestimate the team&#8217;s capacity and input pressure to see more results. On the other hand, when they have it, it is easier to agree on a sustainable development<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To improve visibility on your team, you can:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have your kanban board always updated.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retrieve <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/?s=metrics\">process metrics<\/a><\/strong>, so you have numbers when talking to a stakeholder.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/2016\/03\/why-we-love-metrics-cumulative-flow-diagrams\/\">Cumulative Flow <\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/2016\/03\/why-we-love-metrics-cumulative-flow-diagrams\/\">Diagrams<\/a><\/strong> so you can show where your team lacks efficiency and stop pressuring the wrong people.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid<strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.plataformatec.com.br\/2017\/10\/12-common-mistakes-when-using-process-metrics\/\">common errors when using metrics<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to keep your work items as similar as possible regarding size and complexity.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the latter is not possible or when complexity changes due to discoveries during development (or blocks, as well), make sure this information is somehow visible.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Predictability<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Predictability is knowing when you are going to finish a demand, or what you&#8217;ll produce until a specific date. Without that information, you might find yourself always running against time, because you&#8217;ll never know if you are on the right track or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fear of missing a deadline is the most famous cause of pressure in a team, but if you gather the right information throughout the process, you can negotiate:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More time, and you&#8217;ll have the numbers to say how much time you need;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less scope, and you&#8217;ll have the numbers to say how many stories you can actually deliver by the deadline;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A larger team, and you&#8217;ll have the numbers to say how many people (and their roles) you need to match the deadline. (Disclaimer: this should be your last resource. Changing the team size has different impacts, such as increasing cooperation complexity.
