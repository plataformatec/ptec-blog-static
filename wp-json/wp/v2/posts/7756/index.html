Even though there is a lot of material about that subject, it is pretty common for people to get confused about it, and in the book, Ulisses explains it in such a simple way through lots of examples and refactorings that I am almost sure that you won\u2019t have doubts about this topic anymore.<\/p>\n<h2>Target<\/h2>\n<p>This is a book for people that don&#8217;t have any previous knowledge of functional programming and\/or Elixir. It will walk you through all the necessary subjects for you to understand these concepts in a way that it seems that Ulisses is talking to you face to face.<br \/>\nBut it is important to make it clear that it doesn&#8217;t cover all Elixir topics. You will still need to read more books, after finishing this one, to understand topics such as processes, metaprogramming \u00a0among other things.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>It is definitely a great book for people that need guidance in the functional programming world, the book I wish I had the chance to read when I was first starting. Such a light reading that you can do it on the way to work, without getting lost in the examples, definitely worth it.<\/p>\n<p>Do you want to take a look at the first chapter?<\/p>\n<p>Download it for free in <a href=\"http:\/\/pages.plataformatec.com.br\/chapter-thinking-functionally-of-learn-functional-programming-with-elixir?utm_source=our-blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=chap-thinking-functionally&amp;utm_content=link\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have recently finished reading the book Learn Functional Programming with Elixir, from Ulisses Almeida, published by PragProg.
